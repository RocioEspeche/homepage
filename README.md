My first personal website. Basically it is just a résumé.

## Intro:
My name is Maria Rocio Espeche. I am 26 years old. I am a full stack web developer graduated from Digital House. I really enjoy programming. That's why I decided to enroll in this course. I am looking to continue learning and improving myself to be better every day. I believe my strengths when it comes to programming are my enthusiasm, my desire to excel, and my ability to adapt to different work groups.

## Timeline:
The first project I worked on was the e-commerce website for a fictional book store. It was during a frontend development course. Initially, we were 3 members in the group. Later, one member dropped out. That's where I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. Later on, we also learned DOM. Afterward, I started the full stack development course at Digital House, and there we created a page called "Mercado Liebre," which was a replica of Mercado Libre's homepage. This project was individual, and we carried it out using HTML and CSS. Finally, the final project to pass this course was an e-commerce website for a bicycle shop in Santiago del Estero, Argentina, owned by one of my group mates. We were 6 in total. There, we created wireframes in Figma and then used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and React to build the website. Additionally, we applied agile methodologies (Scrum), so we used Trello board to organize tasks. I feel like I learned a lot and I'm ready for new challenges. Always seeking more.

## Additional info blocks:
Outside the world of programming, I really enjoy dancing. It hasn't been long since I started taking classes, but I truly enjoy it and it's very beneficial for me. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I really like burgers. I'm a fan of romantic movies, and I love cats.
